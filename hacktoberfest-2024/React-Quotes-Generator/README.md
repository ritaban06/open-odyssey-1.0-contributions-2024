You can easily customize the app according to your preferences:

1. **Change the Quotes API**: 
   - In the `App.js`, replace the existing quotes API endpoint with another public API that suits your needs.

2. **Modify Styling**:
   - The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can tweak the existing styles or add new styles in the `App.css` file or directly in JSX using Tailwind classes.

3. **Add More Features**:
   - You can add features like quote categorization, filtering, or saving quotes locally by extending the current functionality.
