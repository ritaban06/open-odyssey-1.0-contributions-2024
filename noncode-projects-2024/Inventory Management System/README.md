## **Inventory Management System**
### **Project Overview**
The **Inventory Management System** is designed to efficiently manage the stock levels of a business, process incoming orders, and handle customer requests. The system facilitates the management of suppliers, tracks inventory levels, processes orders, and generates reports. This solution is essential for maintaining optimal stock levels, minimizing overstock or stock shortages, and ensuring that customer demands are met promptly.

The system is role-based, catering to three user types:
- **Admin**: Manages users and generates reports.
- **Manager**: Manages suppliers, monitors stock levels, and places replenishment orders.
- **Staff**: Updates inventory, processes incoming orders, and handles customer orders.

### **Features**
1. **User Authentication & Role-Based Access**:
   - Secure login system for Admin, Manager, and Staff users.
   - Different dashboards and functionalities based on user roles.

2. **Admin Functionalities**:
   - Manage users (add, update, delete users such as managers and staff).
   - View and generate inventory-related reports such as stock levels, sales, and inventory turnover.

3. **Manager Functionalities**:
   - Manage suppliers (add, update, and remove supplier information).
   - Review current stock levels and place orders to replenish stock when levels are low.

4. **Staff Functionalities**:
   - Update inventory (add new items, update existing stock, and remove old stock).
   - Process incoming orders from suppliers and update stock records.
   - Handle customer orders by checking availability, processing shipments, and managing backorders.

5. **Reports Generation**:
   - Admins can generate reports on:
     - Stock levels.
     - Sales reports.
     - Inventory turnover.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React or Vue for dynamic interfaces).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for REST API services.
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL for managing inventory, users, orders, and suppliers.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Token (JWT) or OAuth for secure role-based access control.
- **Notifications**: Email or SMS notifications using services like Twilio or SendGrid.
- **Payment Processing** (optional for customer orders): Stripe or PayPal for handling payments.
