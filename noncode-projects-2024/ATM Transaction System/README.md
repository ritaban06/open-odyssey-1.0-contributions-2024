# ATM Transaction System  
## Introduction  
The **ATM Transaction System** is a software application designed to automate and streamline banking transactions through an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to securely access their bank accounts and perform various transactions such as withdrawing or depositing cash, checking their account balances, and updating their Personal Identification Number (PIN), all through a user-friendly interface.

The system ensures a secure and efficient banking experience by implementing multiple verification steps, including card authentication, PIN validation, and transaction processing. It connects to a centralized database where user account details are stored, updated in real-time, and accessed for each transaction. This real-time data processing ensures accuracy and reliability in all operations.

## Key Functionalities  
- **Withdraw Cash**: Allows users to withdraw money from their account after verifying sufficient funds.
- **Deposit Cash/Checks**: Enables users to deposit cash or checks and update their account balance.
- **Check Account Balance**: Displays the userâ€™s current account balance.
- **Change PIN**: Allows users to securely update their ATM PIN.

## Key Features  
- **Card Authentication**: Verifies the validity of the ATM card before granting access to transactions.
- **PIN Validation**: Ensures that the correct PIN is entered, with a retry limit to enhance security.
- **Transaction Security**: Securely handles all financial transactions by connecting to the bank's account database.
- **Retry Mechanism**: In case of an incorrect PIN, users can attempt up to three retries before the card is blocked.
- **Real-Time Balance Updates**: After a transaction (deposit or withdrawal), the account balance is updated instantly.
- **Session Timeout**: The system ends the session after each transaction to ensure privacy and security.
  
## System Flowchart  
The following flowchart illustrates the complete transaction flow in the ATM Transaction System:

### Flow Breakdown:
1. **Card Insertion and Validation**: The user inserts their ATM card, which is checked for validity. If invalid, the card is rejected.
2. **PIN Verification**: After a valid card, the user must enter their PIN. The system checks the PIN's correctness and gives three retry attempts before blocking the card.
3. **Transaction Menu**: Upon successful PIN entry, the user can select one of the main transaction options:
   - Withdraw Cash
   - Deposit Cash
   - Check Balance
   - Change PIN
4. **Withdrawal/Deposit Operations**: If the user selects "Withdraw Cash," the system verifies sufficient funds and dispenses cash. For deposits, the system accepts cash or checks and updates the account balance.
5. **Account Balance Inquiry**: The user can request to view their current balance, which is fetched from the account database.
6. **PIN Change**: The user can change their PIN by validating the new PIN and saving it securely in the database.
7. **Session End**: After each transaction, the system updates the account, ejects the card, and thanks the user, ending the session.

## Tech Stack  
To build an ATM Transaction System like this, the following technologies and frameworks could be used:

### Backend:
- **Programming Languages**: 
  - Python or Java for building the logic behind transactions.
  - SQL for database operations.
- **Database**: 
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any relational database to store account details, transaction histories, and user credentials.
  
### Frontend:
- **ATM Interface**: 
  - HTML/CSS, JavaFX, or a custom-built ATM software interface with touchscreen support.
- **Security Framework**: 
  - For PIN validation and encryption, using libraries like **bcrypt** or **SHA-256** encryption.
  
### Middleware:
- **APIs**: 
  - REST or SOAP APIs to communicate between the ATM interface and backend systems for real-time balance retrieval and updates.
  
### Security Features:
- **Encryption**: 
  - AES or RSA encryption to protect sensitive user data like PINs and account information.
- **Secure Login**: 
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for ATM administrators or managers.
  
### Testing:
- **Unit Testing**: 
  - JUnit or PyTest for testing individual components of the system.
- **Integration Testing**: 
  - Postman for testing API endpoints and interactions with the database.
