### **System Architecture**

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Users log in using credentials or sign up with personal information (name, email, password).
   - Authentication using JWT ensures secure login sessions.

2. **Bus Search and Booking**:
   - Users enter search parameters (source, destination, date) to view a list of available buses.
   - The system queries the database for buses that match the user's search and returns relevant results.

3. **Seat Selection and Payment**:
   - Users select available seats, proceed to payment, and confirm their booking.
   - Upon successful payment, the system stores the booking and generates a ticket.
